## 🎮 Content Pipeline (MGCB Editor)

Game assets (textures, sounds, etc.) are managed using the [**MonoGame Content Builder (MGCB)**](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/tools/mgcb_editor.html).

### 🛠️ Editing Content

To add or modify content:

1. Open the `.mgcb` file using the MGCB Editor.
2. Use the interface to add assets (e.g., `.png`, `.wav`) and configure import settings.
3. Save and build to update `Content.mgcb`.
